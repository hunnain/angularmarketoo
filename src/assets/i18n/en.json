  "bid_ex_q2": "Why should I pay for higher clicks?",
  "bid_ex_a2": "Higher clicks correlate with a more prominent position when sellers share same Ad score and same Product Quality score, thereby delivering clicks faster for a successful campaign and competing with other sellers in the category in a given period of time.",
  "bid_ex_q3": "If I do not pay for higher clicks, does this mean my Boosting ads will perform poorly?",
  "bid_ex_a3": "No. Your Boosting listing will be shown in relevant search and browse results. We will still aim to deliver 100% of your daily budget. Your Boosting performance will not be impacted.

  "bid_ex_q9": "Is Boosting subject to other considerations?",
  "bid_ex_a9": "However, ads are still subject to other considerations such as Ad score. Only in conditions where two running campaigns are in the same Ad score and are equally relevant to a buyer’s search term will the prioritised Boosting ad be higher bided over the less prominent Boosting ad. For example, if a buyer searches Marketoo Lucky Charm, two Boosting ads with the title Marketoo Lucky Charm will compete for prominence in search results. The higher Product Quality score with higher bids will be shown first.",
  "bid_ex_q10": "How do you calculate Ads score?",
  "bid_ex_a10": "Ad Score = Max. CPC Bid x Listing Quality Score.\n  o In the ad auction mechanism, exposure priority is determined by the total ad score. The total ad score consists of two main factors:\n o With regards to the ad system, listing quality scores are just as important as the max. CPC bid. Designers are advised to optimise product pages to improve listing quality scores before running ads in order to help listings become more visible to potential customers. Optimised product pages can also help in getting better ad positions. If the quality of the product page is poor, it is not easy to get exposure regardless if you set a high max. CPC bid.\n o Note: When a listing violates Marketoo’s Allowed & Prohibited Items policy and is reported to Marketoo via the “Report this item” function, the system will prohibit the listing from being exposed to users through ad positions.",
  "bid_ex_q11": "How long will my listing stay in Boosting?",
  "bid_ex_a11": "Your listing will stay in Boosting for as long as you set your campaign duration to be (3–30 days) and will pause for the day once you’ve reached your daily budget (or targeted number of clicks per day). Marking your listing as “Sold”, “Out Of Stock”, “Deleted” or changing its category will stop your Boosting immediately. Reserved listing's promotion will be paused for a maximum 24 hours. Within 24h, re- list the listing will bring back the promotion automatically. Over 24h, then it will be stopped. Re-listing will not cost any surcharge within the duration you paid for.",
  "bid_ex_q12": "Where can I find my boosting?",

When they scroll past a listing, it’s counted as an impression. When they tap into the listing to view more details, it’s counted as a click \n o A user has to tap into your Boosting listing for us to count it as a click. On top of that, each click will be unique; if the same user taps into your listing twice on the same day, it will only be counted as 1 click.",
